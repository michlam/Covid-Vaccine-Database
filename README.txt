NOTES
- You can only register for an account if your PHN is in the Clients_LiveAt Table
- When you input vaccine names, they should have the same name but this is not enforced
- The number of appointments is not restricted. Someone could make as many as they want.
- For a vaccination to be properly recorded, the worker official pair must be unique in Worker_ReportingTo_Officials. This affects the view vaccine quantity function.
